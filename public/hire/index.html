	<h2>How I Work</h2>
	<p>I go to great lengths to ensure my work is of the highest quality. I am very flexible to customer requests, but there are certain qualities that I'm not willing to compromise on.</p>
	<p>This ensures my work is always:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>üç¶ Vanilla</strong>: I like doing things in the native, old-fashioned way where possible to enjoy full control over what does what. I only add tools to my workflow when they offer value for my projects.</li>
		<li><strong>üìã Standards-compliant</strong>: I make great efforts to use the most semantically correct markup possible in every scenario. This inherently makes my work search engine friendly and easily accessible by both humans and computers.</li>
		<li><strong>üöÄ Fast</strong>: I optimize my code and all project assets for performance, and I don't use unnecessary features that would result in a cumbersome experience on less capable devices. Remember Vanilla?</li>
		<li><strong>üì± Responsive</strong>: I make sure that a website works well and looks good on everything from mobile touchscreen devices to touchpad- or mouse and keyboard-controlled desktop computers.</li>
		<li><strong>‚ôø Accessible</strong>: I do my best to provide an accessible user experience to everyone, including people who are confined to using screen readers, or people with visual impairments or mental health conditions.</li>
		<li><strong>üîé SEO-friendly</strong>: A lot of the on-site search engine optimization comes from writing semantically correct code, which I mentioned above. That, and some handmade adjustments will all increase a website's chances of ranking better in Google and other search engines.</li>
		<li><strong>üß± Progressively enhanced</strong>: I build a very strong code foundation for my projects, and enable certain modern features as more capable browsers and devices allow for them. This results in a website being approachable even in older browsers.</li>
		<li><strong>üìê Easy to scale and maintain</strong>: Starting with a strong code foundation, as mentioned above, also makes websites very easy to maintain and scale up as the business grows over time.</li>
	</ul>

		<h2 class="read-more__title">Design Process</h2>
		<p class="read-more__description">If you're interested in how I work on the ideal project, check out my Design Process page.</p>
		<a class="button read-more__button" href="/process/">Read</a>
	</aside>
	<p>As an all-rounder professional I perform the best when I am in charge of all things that are of my expertise. This means I prefer working solo on a project, but if you have other designers or developers on your team, and looking for a helping hand, I am happy to work as a member of a team.</p>
	<p>I work <strong>remotely</strong> from my home office in Budapest. I have no problem working early mornings or late nights to overcome timezone differences.</p>

	<h2>Freelancing FAQ</h2>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Is my idea all you need to start on my project?</summary>
		<p><strong>No.</strong> I'm neither a copywriter, nor an illustrator, nor a brand identity designer. Please have your copy, images and logos ready before jumping in. If your project requires stock imagery, I can assist in finding the right ones.</p>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Will you finalize my project that was left unfinished?</summary>
		<p><strong>Yes</strong>, but in different ways.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have all your wireframes ready, I can use that to create a functional design and write the code for it.</li>
			<li>If you have all the designs ready for your project, I can immediately start coding it, easy-peasy.</li>
			<li>If your project was halted in the middle of any of the abovementioned phases, I'd prefer scrapping whatever you have in that particular phase, and restarting that phase of the process.</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Will you design a logo for my project as well?</summary>
		<p><strong>Yes. -ish.</strong> I'm really good at the problem-solving end of design, however, I don't consider myself a creative person. That being said, I can certainly design a functional logo for your project, but I definitely won't be able to create that ridiculously awesome logo that will land on the next Best Logo Designs of 2020 list.</p>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Will you design collaterals, like business cards or letterheads?</summary>
		<p><strong>Yes.</strong> If required, I can definitely help with collateral design, on the same terms as above. It works best when you already have a logo, and/or some kind of visual direction.</p>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Can you put my website on the first page of Google's search results?</summary>
		<p><strong>No.</strong> I cannot guarantee that Google will place your website higher up in the search rankings. However, I always author my code with great care on semantics in an effort to increase the chances of it.</p>
	</details>
	<details class="faq">
		<summary class="faq__question">Is my website going to look the same in every browser?</summary>
		<p><strong>No.</strong> Only the most modern browsers will be able to provide the fullest user experience. Older browsers will still be able to approach and render the website's contents, but at a reduced fidelity in some cases. This is because older browsers are not updated with new features of the Web anymore, and can only use their limited capabilities to display websites.</p>
