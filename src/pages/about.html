		<h2>How It All Started</h2>
		<p>I've always had a passion for website creation. In fact, I used to skip university classes to teach myself WordPress and build my own web design blog. For five years, that blog became a hub of creative experimentation and learning, and it gave me the hands-on experience that helped me grow into the WordPress expert I am today.</p>
		<p>Over the years, I've honed my skills, learning the ins and outs of custom WordPress development. With every new project, there's something fresh to learn, and I love pushing WordPress to its limits to deliver exactly what my clients need.</p>
