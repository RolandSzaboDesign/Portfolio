					<p>In the past decade, I've had the privilege of working across various industries—building and optimizing websites for VPN companies, privacy advocates, SEO firms, and tech startups. Each of these experiences has sharpened my skills in web design, web development, and performance optimization. Along the way, I've managed teams, led design efforts, and created hundreds of websites of all kinds.</p>
					<p>Whether it's designing a sleek, responsive interface or developing custom WordPress themes and web applications, I'm constantly refining my craft to deliver the best possible results.</p>

			<h2>How It All Started</h2>
			<p class="mb-0">My passion for web design began during my university years, where I taught myself WordPress and launched my web design blog. That experience became the foundation for my journey in WordPress development, and it still drives my love for pushing the limits of what websites can achieve.</p>
