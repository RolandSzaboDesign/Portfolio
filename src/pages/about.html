			<p>With over a decade of experience in the web design and development industry, I’ve had the opportunity to work across a diverse range of companies—from a dynamic startup environment at The Pulilab to leading design initiatives at ProPrivacy.com. Throughout my career, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, while also mastering web performance and responsive design. My journey has taken me from crafting seamless user interfaces for VPN services at Buffered VPN to developing complex web applications at TwitterAudit and Retalk, where I utilized Laravel and Vue.js to create high-performing, scalable websites.</p>
			<p>As a designer-coder hybrid, I’ve consistently pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in web development, blending design aesthetics with cutting-edge technology to deliver fast, efficient, and user-friendly websites. Whether working in a collaborative team setting or leading projects independently, my focus has always been on creating websites that not only meet but exceed client expectations. Now, as a full-time freelancer, I’m dedicated to simplifying the website creation process, offering my clients tailored solutions that bring their visions to life with minimal hassle.</p>
