				<p class="h3">AI-Driven Pipe Repair Robot User Interface Design</p>
				<p>Polinvent's AI-driven pipe repair robot is a small yet powerful machine used in industrial and civil environments.</p>
				<p><strong class="text-light">Challenge:</strong> The interface needed to fit within a 16:9 display without any scrolling, and the design had to be accessible to workers wearing gloves. This posed the challenge of creating large, easy-to-press buttons without sacrificing the clarity of the information displayed on-screen.</p>
				<p><strong class="text-light">Solution:</strong> I designed an intuitive interface where all vital functions and information were accessible without the need for scrolling. By strategically placing large buttons and arranging data in a compact yet readable format, I ensured the UI would be easy to navigate, even for gloved users. This design helped streamline operations, allowing workers to save time and operate the machine efficiently in challenging conditions.</p>

				<p class="h3">Custom WordPress Website for a Visual Artist</p>
				<p>László Magyar, also known as LaczaDesign, is a talented 2D/3D visual artist who creates custom digital artwork for the music industry.</p>
				<p><strong class="text-light">Challenge:</strong> He needed a website that would showcase his vibrant, intricate designs without overwhelming viewers. To achieve this, we needed a monochromatic website that allowed his colorful works to take center stage. Additionally, the challenge was to display hundreds of high-quality images on one page without sacrificing performance or load times.</p>
				<p><strong class="text-light">Solution:</strong> I developed a custom WordPress theme from scratch, focusing on a minimalist, monochromatic design that highlighted LaczaDesign’s portfolio. Each artwork category was enhanced with custom fields, enabling László to add specific details like the artist's name, production year, and project description for each piece. For performance optimization, I implemented lazy loading and optimized images, ensuring the site loaded quickly even with hundreds of images displayed at once. This provided a seamless and visually striking user experience.</p>
