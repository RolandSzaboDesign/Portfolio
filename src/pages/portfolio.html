			<p><strong class="text-light">Challenge:</strong> Orsi needed a versatile and elegant online presence that would serve audiences across multiple languages. Essential features included a dynamic event system for listing upcoming and past performances, a gallery to showcase <a href="https://rolandszabo.photo/en/">stunning branding photography</a>, and the ability to embed videos. Additionally, a comprehensive contact form was required to handle various booking requests. Starting from scratch, we also created a coming soon page to generate early interest.</p>
