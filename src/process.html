			<h2 class="process__title process__title--odd">Idea</h2>
			<p class="process__description">It all starts with a friendly conversation. You present me your idea for the project, and I ask a lot of questions afterwards, including your goals, users, competition and any special requests you may have.</p>
			<p class="process__description">In order to deliver the absolute best results, I need to fully understand what problems you'd like to solve, and how your product needs to work. We also set clear expectations to each other, to make sure that we're on the same page.</p>

			<h2 class="process__title process__title--even">Wireframes</h2>
			<p class="process__description">After having a solid understanding of your project, I begin work by creating paper and digital sketches. I explore numerous <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> patterns and <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr> best practices, to decide what would work best for your needs, taking into account what we've agreed upon in the Idea phase.</p>
			<p class="process__description">Once this is done, I'll turn these results into mockups or functional wireframes in a mobile, tablet and desktop variaton. During this process, I'll send you the completed wireframes for feedback and approval in a regular, possibly daily manner.</p>

		<article class="process__content">
			<h2 class="process__title process__title--odd">Visual Design</h2>
			<p class="process__description">Once you're satisfied with the wireframes, I'll start designing the look and feel of your project. The goal is to create a visual direction or atmosphere using typography, color and whitespace. Not all web pages will be meticulously designed, only the most important ones. The rest of the pages will be built using the very same visual style in the Coding phase.</p>
			<p class="process__description">You'll have plenty of opportunities to review the designs and provide feedback. Once you're content with the designs and the overall visual style, we'll refrain from any major visual changes.</p>

		<article class="process__content">
			<h2 class="process__title process__title--even">Coding and Testing</h2>
			<p class="process__description">The development of your project starts by establishing a solid code foundation that the rest of your project will be based on. This foundation will ensure your website remains scalable and easy to maintain.</p>
			<p class="process__description">What you ultimately get is a functional website, which provides a great user experience on all screen sizes, loads fast, and is search engine-friendly. Furthermore, it is accessible by users with various disabilities, and will work elegantly in older, less capable web browsers.</p>
			<p class="process__description">I will conduct various types of testing on the finished code to make sure it remains functional in extreme scenarios.</p>

			<h2 class="process__title process__title--odd">Training and Liftoff!</h2>
			<p class="process__description">When the Coding phase is complete, I'll give you an overview of what has been done and what the results are. If applicable, I will give you an in-depth training of how to use and update your website in the future.</p>
			<p class="process__description">Once everything is set, all that's left to do is to launch your shiny new project. I'll take care of setting everything up on your webserver, so that when the time is right, your new website can go live and be accessible to everyone.</p>
