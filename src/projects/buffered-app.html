<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>During my time at Buffered from 2015 to 2018, I've had a wide variety of tasks to do, but undoubtedly my most exciting one was the application design of our VPN app.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the app were ease of use, cross-platform functionality and consistent look and feel with our brand.</p>
<p>I started off the design process by creating a set of reusable components like texts, buttons, status indicators, etc. There have been over 30 screens created and designed for the final version.</p>
<p>The application was written in Qt by our in-house developers. It was my responsibility to work closely with them to ensure a consistent design and that every pixel was in the right place.</p>
<p>The application has enabled ~100.000 users worldwide to use the internet safely and securely. Buffered VPN has since been acquired by Encrypt.me, so the app is not available for download anymore.</p>
