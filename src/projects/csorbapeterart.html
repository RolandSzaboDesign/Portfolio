<h2>Project Description</h2>

</div>
<p>Péter is a Hungarian-American contemporary fine art painter from Transylvania. He works primarily with oils and creates his own canvas for each of his art pieces as part of the process.</p>
<p>The website, other than the standard informational pages, and a custom gallery, features a conventional blog with newsletter functionality. It will feature a Woocommerce webshop in the near future, once he finalizes his artworks for sale.</p>
<p>We intentionally went for a super minimalistic design for Peter's website, as this was the direction we both wanted to aim for.</p>
