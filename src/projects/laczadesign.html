<p>Lacza is a self-taught freelance digital artist and designer based in Hungary.</p>
<p>He specializes in creating artworks for world-renowned music labels such as Revealed Recordings, Monstercat, EDM Joy and the likes. He's also worked with a lot of famous faces from the EDM scene, like Hardwell, Paul van Dyk, Dash Berlin, Zatox, Kaaze, and many more.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of creating a very minimalistic website for Lacza that features his artworks in their full glory. This is a site where images do most of the talking.</p>
<p>If you're an artist and are looking for a similar website, feel free to contact me, I'd love to put together a personalized website design for you.</p>
