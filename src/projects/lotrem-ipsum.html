<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>As a web developer I use random texts a lot in my work. Almost always I place the output text inside HTML tags, but I have to do this manually every time. I quickly felt the need to create a text generator that will mark up text for me. Sprinkle that with Hobbits, Dwarves and Gandalf himself, and you've got LOTRem Ipsum.</p>
<p>The tool has two main operational modes; one for generating marked up text for web developers (currently called Advanced Mode), and one for plain text generation for print designers and everyone else.</p>
<p>The words are randomly generated from the subtitles of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films. Some of the most iconic quotes also appear among the generated sentences.</p>
<p>We're in the planning phase of redoing LOTRem Ipsum from the ground up, adding more quality of life features, fancy new graphics, and an overall less Mordory, more moderny look and feel.</p>
