<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>Retalk is an open forum dedicated to free speech and free discourse, in opposition to the trend of censorship and political bias in Big Tech and social media.</p>
<p>We had a huge task at hand when designing and developing Retalk. Being a complete social media platform for a specific demographic, we had to design our UI and UX in a way that would best fit these needs.</p>
<p>Over time we introduced things like various types of Posts like Polls and Surveys, and Retalk Blogs, all of which to improve user experience and facilitate variety and a sense of belonging to our users. Integrating all these projects into the design system, while still keeping maximum consistency was a great challenge and a tremendous experience to work on.</p>
