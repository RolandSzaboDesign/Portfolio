<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>We purchased TwitterAudit from its original owner and fully revamped its design and backend. It was a fantastic challenge to work on it, as we knew it would be used by thosands of people every day.</p>
<p>Designing and developing project wasn't without its hindrances. Along the project we were faced with many challenges and unforseen events in Twitter's leadership and changes to its APIs. This lead us to think and act quickly in many occasions.</p>
<p>The project has since been sold, and its design and UI has been tinkered with somwehat. Therefore I can't show any screenshots of the final version when I was in charge of the project, only a few samples from the Figma plans back from its inception phase.</p>
